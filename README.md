# Employee-Tracker

## Description

I am pleased to present the final product of this employee tracker project. The purpose of this project is to view/update a corporations structure using information stored on a database. Instead of having to keep track of multiple different files or documents, this project streamlines the entire process by simply executing the written code.

## Installation

Installation is quite simple with this project. The user simply clones this repository, then once inside the directory where it has been clones,  the user runs npm i to install the necessary dependencies.

## Demo

Please follow the link to a video of the project's functionality being demonstrated. 

## Usage

The first thing the user must do to use this project, is updating the information at the top of the index.js file with their own username & password. Once this is completed, the user runs "node index.js" to start the application. 

## Credit

All code in this project was written by myself, however credit goes to the packages used.
Packages used: Inquirer, MySQL, Console.table, Node.js
